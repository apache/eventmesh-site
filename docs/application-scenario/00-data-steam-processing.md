&emsp;&emsp;Based on the figure above, EventMesh is between customer data and target data sources, and can support streaming data processing. Through the filter\transformer capabilities of the EventMesh function, the data format and content desired by the customer can be processed and spit out to the target data source to achieve data cleaning, rule filtering, character replacement, data enrichment, data routing and other capabilities.
