# Event Store with Docker

## 1. Prerequisites

- 64-bit OS, we recommend Linux/Unix.
- 4GB+ available disk to deploy Event Store

This document provides an example of deploying it with RocketMQ as Event Store, but you can also choose another [Event Store supported by EventMesh](../roadmap.md#event-store-implementation-status). If you choose default standalone mode, you could skip this file and go to the next step: Deploy EventMesh Runtime; if not, you could choose RocketMQ as the store layer.

In a production environment, you should use an Event Store other than standalone to support greater throughput and higher availability.

## 2. Deploy

### 2.1 Pull Images

Pull RocketMQ image from Docker Hub:

```shell
#Pull rocketmq image
sudo docker pull apache/rocketmq:4.9.4
```

You can list and view existing local mirrors with the following command:

```shell
sudo docker images
```

If the terminal displays the image information as shown below, the RocketMQ image has been successfully downloaded locally.

```shell
REPOSITORY        TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
apache/rocketmq   4.9.4     a2a50ca263c3   13 months ago   548MB
```

### 2.2 Run Docker

Run namesrv container:

```shell

sudo docker run -d -p 9876:9876 \
  -v `pwd`/data/namesrv/logs:/root/logs \
  -v `pwd`/data/namesrv/store:/root/store \
  --name rmqnamesrv \
  apache/rocketmq:4.9.4 \
  sh mqnamesrv

```

Run broker container:

```shell
sudo docker run -d -p 10911:10911 -p 10909:10909 \
  -v `pwd`/data/broker/logs:/root/logs \
  -v `pwd`/data/broker/store:/root/store \
  --name rmqbroker \
  --link rmqnamesrv:namesrv \
  -e "NAMESRV_ADDR=namesrv:9876" \
  apache/rocketmq:4.9.4 \
  sh mqbroker -c ../conf/broker.conf

```

Please note that the `rocketmq-broker ip` is `pod ip`. If you want to modify this ip, you can set it your custom value in `broker.conf`ã€‚

By now, the deployment of Event Store has finished, please go to the next step: [Start EventMesh Runtime Using Docker](./04-runtime-with-docker.md)
