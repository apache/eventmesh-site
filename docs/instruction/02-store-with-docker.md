# Event Store with Docker

## 1. Dependencies

- 64-bit OS, we recommend Linux/Unix.

- 64-bit JDK 1.8 or JDK 11

- Gradle 7.0+, The recommended version can be found in the `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file.

- 4GB+ available disk to deploy Event Store

If you choose standalone mode, you could skip this file and go to the next step: Start EventMesh Runtime; if not, you could choose RocketMQ as the store layer.

## 2. Deploy

### 2.1 Pull Images

Pull RocketMQ image from Docker Hub:

```shell
#Pull rocketmq image
sudo docker pull apache/rocketmq:4.9.4
```

You can list and view existing local mirrors with the following command:

```shell
sudo docker images
```

If the terminal displays the image information as shown below, the RocketMQ image has been successfully downloaded locally.

```shell
REPOSITORY        TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
apache/rocketmq   4.9.4     a2a50ca263c3   13 months ago   548MB
```

Please note that the **rocketmq-broker ip** is **pod ip**. If you want to modify this ip, you can set it your custom value in **broker.conf**ã€‚

By now, the deployment of Event Store has finished, please go to the next step: [Start EventMesh Runtime Using Docker](./04-runtime-with-docker.md)
