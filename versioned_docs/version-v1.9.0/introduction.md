**Apache EventMesh** is a fully serverless platform used to build distributed [event-driven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture)  applications. 

## Features

Apache EventMesh has a vast amount of features to help users achieve their goals. Let us share with you some of the key features EventMesh has to offer:

- Built around the [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io) specification.
- Rapidly extensible language sdk around [gRPC](https://grpc.io) protocols.
- Rapidly extensible middleware by connectors such as [Apache RocketMQ](https://rocketmq.apache.org), [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org), [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org), [RabbitMQ](https://rabbitmq.com), [Redis](https://redis.io), [Pravega](https://cncf.pravega.io), and [RDMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database)(in progress) using [JDBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Database_Connectivity).
- Rapidly extensible controller such as [Consul](https://consulproject.org/en/), [Nacos](https://nacos.io), [ETCD](https://etcd.io) and [Zookeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/).
- Guaranteed at-least-once delivery.
- Deliver events between multiple EventMesh deployments.
- Event schema management by catalog service.
- Powerful event orchestration by [Serverless workflow](https://serverlessworkflow.io/) engine.
- Powerful event filtering and transformation.
- Rapid, seamless scalability.
- Easy Function develop and framework integration.
