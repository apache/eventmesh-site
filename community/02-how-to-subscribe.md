# How to Subscribe

Apache has configured a series of mailing lists for each project. Mailing lists are an important form of communication in the Apache community.

Many things in the daily operation and maintenance of the community are carried by mailing lists, such as technical discussions, any ideas or suggestions, project questions and answers, new functions/features/major changes decisions and notifications, version release voting, etc. As long as it is related to the project, you can initiate a discussion here.

As long as you subscribe to this mailing list, you can get the latest developments in the EventMesh community for the first time and keep pace with the community.

For new problem/ideas, you can create a new issue through \[new issues\], and describe the issues in detail as much as possible, so that community members can follow up, discuss and solve them. For any problems of the project, it is recommended to create issues first to record and follow up, so that the entire process can be well preserved and archived to facilitate subsequent users to retrieve.

For existing issues, if you are interested, you can reply and discuss as much as you want. For tasks/bug-type issues, if you are interested, you can follow or directly participate in the task. Community partners are very welcome to contribute their efforts to EventMesh.
